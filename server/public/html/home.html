            <h2>To start the game</h2>
            <p>
                Have one player click the start game button and copy the given code. Share that code with the second player. The second player should press the join game button and then paste the code into the box and press enter.
            </p>

            <h2>Game Rules</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Objective:</b> Players are Red and Blue armies aiming to seize and control a region, while maintaining support of the populace. The winner is the player with the most victory points (VPs) at the end of 6 turns. Each city under your control (devoid of enemy units) is worth 4 VP, and each village is worth 2 VP, and the level of one's Support Tracker also gives VPs.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Turns:</b> During each turn, players roll for Initiative, conduct Actions by spending CP, conduct Close Combat, and then Reset. For every two Civilian casualties a player inflicts, at any time, their Support Marker moves left by 1 space. If either player lands on the “LOSE” square the other player immediately wins the game.
                <br>
                <i>Initiative:</i> Each player rolls a d6, the player that rolls higher will take their turn first. If tied, reroll.
                <br>
                <i>Actions:</i> Each player can spend up to 6 CPs per turn to conduct Actions (in the blue box). Resolve an Action immediately then conduct the next Action. Players may conduct the same Action multiple times in one turn. Track CP spent on the CP tracker.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>How to Resolve Combat:</b> For all Combat Actions (Long-Range and Close Combat), the player rolls twice. The first roll determines casualties for the opposing Armies, the second determines Civilian casualties. Each casualty removes one Army or subtracts 1 from the CIV. Track Civilian casualties inflicted with a CIV dice in each teams Civilian Casualties box. For every pair of Civilian casualties caused, the Support Marker is reduced by one.
            </p>

            <p>
                <i>Support Marker:</i> After losing support, combat increases in difficulty and players will have less CP to spend each turn as denoted on the Support Tracker.
            </p>

            <p>
                <i>Close Combat.</i> Once all CP are spent, if there are any opposing Armies in any one node, roll for Close Combat. In Close Combat, each player may roll up to one die for every Army in the contested node. Each player inflicts casualties on the opposing Armies on rolls of 5-6. Then reroll the same number of dice for Civilian casualties which occur on rolls of 6. The player whose turn it is rolls for Civilian causalities first, the second player only rolls if there are Civilians remaining in the node. During a player's turn, only roll for Close Combat once per node.
            </p>

            <p>
                <i>Reset.</i> At the end of every turn reset will happen in two parts
                <br>
                <i>Civilian Movement.</i> The active player rolls the d10, the node with the corresponding number will gain or civilians. To deter the change in population in this node, roll a d6 3 times, for every even roll add 1 and for every odd number subtract 1. Conduct this process twice.
                <br>
                <i>Civilians Return from Haven.</i> If a player used CHMR, roll to move the Civilians. Each Temporary Haven has numbers near each connecting node which denote the dice roll corresponding to Civilians moving to that node. Roll a d6 for every Civilian in the Temporary Haven, then add one to the CIV of the corresponding node for each dice rolled, remove the gray cubes. The Armies that escorted the civilians may be returned to any friendly adjacent node.
            </p>

            <p>
                Reset CP tracker back to 6. Any remaining CP do NOT carry over to the next turn. Then the next player conducts their turn.
                <br>
                After both players complete a turn increase the number on the die in the Turn Tracker by 1 and then reroll for initiative for the next turn. Players alternate turns until 6 turns have been played or one player's entire army is eliminated. After 6 turns, if there is any unresolved combat, repeat Close Combat until each node is controlled by one player. Both players must roll at least one d6 in this case. Then add up the VPs of all controlled nodes and VP granted by your position on the Support Tracker. Whoever has more VP, wins the game.

            <h2>About Violent Victory</h2>
            <p>
                2 players, 20 - 30 minutes
            </p>

            <p>
                Violent Victory is an educational microgame designed to introduce players to the importance of civilian harm mitigation and response (CHMR) in achieving long-term victory in an armed conflict. Limiting civilian casualties in conflict is not only the moral and ethical imperative, but a critical element in determining success after the battle ends. Military success on the battlefield in the absence of popular support rarely translates to strategic success. Admittedly, this game is a simplified representation of the complex dynamics and interactions of civilians in the horrors of armed conflict. For instance, the movement of civilians to a Temporary Haven and their subsequent movement to another node aims to reflect the civilian displacement common in conflict. The difficulty of keeping strategic nodes civilian free demonstrates the lack of control that militaries have in keeping civilians out of their homes if they wish to stay.
            </p>

            <p>
                Within the game, players will have to balance expending resources on combat actions versus committing resources to increase the safety of civilians. If players disregard the safety of civilians, they may control all the cities, however their local support will be too low to maintain stability after the conflict. Players will have to resist the temptation to win battles at any cost.
            </p>

            <p>
                Victory in war requires violence, but the degree of the violence determines the nature of the victory.
