I used an article describing how to solve the knapsack problem to help with the design of my DP table. The class notes only offer the example for matrix multiplication, which is a very different example, and I forgot exactly how building the table should go.

Most of the explanation is found in the code comments, but there isn't anything special. I've solved recursive problems similar to this before, with memoization (if you care to know, Advent of Code 2023 Day 12: https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/12). The dynamic programming part was just implementing the table that I had to come up with.

The only thing to come up with was what the DP table should be, and using the knapsack problem as reference made that simple after thinking about it for a couple minutes.

Runtime analysis: pretty fast.
