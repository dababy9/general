- hide elements when popups occur (including CPMENU and maybe animations???)
- change move to be more intuitive
- just reorganize screen?
- Change population changes to be animated numbers
- Maybe also do with armies
- Maybe add ring animation when firing


BUGS
- combat actions sometimes don't send the correct number of removed
- CHMR -> you can move to contested node :(
- change VP from support to match game board
